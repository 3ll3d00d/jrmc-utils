create test chart in displaycal
gamma
* white patches: 1
* single channel patches: 0
* black patches: 1
* neutral patches: n+1 (e.g. 20 point gamma set to 21)
* dark region emphasis: 0
* iterative patches: 0
* create test chart
* sort by Maximize lightness difference
* save testchart (ti1)
* export csv 0..100

lut
* run using madtpg and auto optimised chart
* wait til it completes the preconditioning characterisation (34 point measurement)
* pause the measurements
* go to the most recently updated %LOCALAPPDATA%/Temp/DisplayCal-xxxxx (where xxxxx is some set of chars) folder
* copy the files from here to some other location, there should be files with the following extensions
  * cal
  * icm (contains the preconditioning profile)
  * log (contains information needed to know how to drive targen)
  * ti1 
  * ti3
* review the log file to see the switches used to drive targen, e.g.

targen.exe
   -v
   -d3
   -e4
   -s33
   -g97
   -m0
   -f1519
   -A1.0
   -G
   -N0.5
   -B4
   -b0
   -V1.6
   -c
   "madVR 2023-05-31 10-24 0.3127x 0.329y S XYZLUT+MTX.icm"
   "madVR 2023-05-31 10-24 0.3127x 0.329y S XYZLUT+MTX"

* varying the size of the test chart is achieved by changing the following
  * s : single channel steps
  * g : grey axis steps
  * f : patches

* cancel the measurement
* switch to untethered mode
* open the testchart editor
* update the various params to match the above settings inc adding the preconditioning profile (copied from temp)
* sort by Maximize lightness difference
* save testchart (ti1)
* export csv 0..100
